## How to Hydrate

### Hydrating using [Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) (GUI)
Navigate to the [Hydrator github repository](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) and follow the instructions for installation in their README. As there are a lot of separate Tweet ID files in this repository, it might be advisable to first merge files from timeframes of interest into a larger file before hydrating the Tweets through the GUI. 

### Hydrating using [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) (CLI)
Many thanks to Ed Summers ([edsu](https://github.com/edsu)) and Github user [SamSamhuns](https://github.com/SamSamhuns) for writing this script that uses [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) to hydrate all Tweet-IDs stored in their corresponding folders.
